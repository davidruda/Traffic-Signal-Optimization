Traffic signal optimization is an important problem in today's world due to its
significant impact on urban mobility and the environment. Effective traffic
signal optimization reduces delays at intersections, which directly translates
to saving time for commuters and improving the overall efficiency of
transportation networks. By minimizing congestion, optimized traffic signals
facilitate smoother traffic flow, which not only enhances the daily commute
experience but also supports the economic vitality of urban areas by reducing
the time lost in traffic.

Additionally, efficient traffic signal timing plays a
critical role in reducing vehicle emissions, thereby contributing to lower
pollution levels and promoting environmental sustainability. Furthermore, as
urban populations continue to grow, the demand for more intelligent and
responsive traffic management systems increases, making traffic signal
optimization a key component in the development of smart cities and sustainable
urban infrastructures.
