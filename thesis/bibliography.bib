%[**Building a Simulator and Emulator for Traffic Signalling**](https://victorzxy.github.io/project/traffic-sim/) ([PDF](https://victorzxy.github.io/project/traffic-sim/TrafficSim-Report.pdf))  
%- based on the same problem from the Hash Code 2021 qualification round  
%
%[**Iterated Local Search with Genetic Algorithms for the Photo Slideshow Problem**](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-26504-4_45)  
%- optimization of a problem from the Hash Code 2019 qualification round - the task and techniques used are very similar to our problem

%
%[A heuristics based approach for optimizing delivery schedule of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (Drone) based delivery system](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8593145)  
%- optimization of a problem from the Hash Code 2016 qualification round - the task is quite different from our case
%
%[Applied routing problem for a fleet of delivery drones using
%a modified parallel genetic algorithm](https://dspace.spbu.ru/bitstream/11701/36938/1/135-148.pdf)  
%- optimization of a problem from the Hash Code 2016 qualification round
%
%[A parallel memetic algorithm with explicit management of diversity for the job shop scheduling problem](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-021-02406-2)  
%- uses a problem from the Hash Code 2020 finals
%
%[Towards Efficient Solvers for Optimisation Problems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8752700)  
%- uses a problem from the Hash Code 2017 qualification round  
%
%[Genetic algorithms and greedy-randomized adaptive search procedure for router placement problem in wireless networks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335374967_Genetic_algorithms_and_greedy-randomized_adaptive_search_procedure_for_router_placement_problem_in_wireless_networks)  
%-  also uses some problem from Hash Code, but it's not publicly available (only upon request from the authors)
