## Easy setup
  - ### Run `make test` to set up the environment and run all tests

### How to build and install the `traffic_signaling` package for use in Python

- C++20 code - `gcc 11`, `clang 16` or `MSVC 19.29` (or later) is required to build the package

- Note that you need to have Python headers installed on your system in order to build the package (some Linux distributions donâ€™t install them by default)

  - You can check the location of the headers by running `python3 -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_path('include'))"`
  - If not available, install them; e.g. `sudo apt install python3-dev` on Ubuntu

- Run `pip install ./traffic_signaling` (preferably in a virtual environment)
  - If the package somehow builds in Debug mode, try running `CPPFLAGS="-O3" pip install ./traffic_signaling`

- Optionally, verify the package by running tests:

  - `pip install -r requirements-test.txt`
  - `python3 -m unittest discover -s traffic_signaling/tests`
